If an entire game is used to predict the winner, it will no doubt learn that the person 
closest to losing their last stock determines the winner so if a data point is a single
game, it will bias its learning to the end of the game and get 100% accuracy, but in
real time it will not have access to that.

So for each game, it should be broken into several records.  Probably 5 seconds at a 
time, 2 frames per second, but also right padded so that almost the entire game 
history can be taken into account.  

500 time steps per record, and using 2 frames per second, the time length for input is
just over 4 minutes.  Matches that go longer will truncate from the beginning of the match.
